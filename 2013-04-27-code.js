 * [Roman Numeral Conversion](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRomanNumerals)
 *
 * The Romans were a clever bunch. They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for
 * hundreds of years. They invented concrete and straight roads and even bikinis. One
 * thing they never discovered though was the number zero. This made writing and
 * dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the
 * system of numbers they came up with is still in use today. For example the BBC
 * uses Roman numerals to date their programmes.
 *
 * The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these
 * letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets)
 *
 * Given a decimal number, convert to a Roman numeral representation. For example,
 * in Roman numerals, decimal 1999 becomes "MCMXCIX". BONUS: Given a Roman numeral,
 * convert back into a decimal number.
